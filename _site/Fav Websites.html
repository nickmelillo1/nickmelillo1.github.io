<a href="https://www.rei.com/" target="_parent">REI</a> is one of my favorite websites because I love outdoor gear. They even have a portion of their cite, where you can purchase used goods and they are a lot more affordable that way. They are generally in excellent condition as well.

<a href="https://www.alltrails.com/?ref=header/" target="_parent">AllTrails</a> is also one of my favorite websites. It is the cite I utilize to find hiking and backpacking trails.
