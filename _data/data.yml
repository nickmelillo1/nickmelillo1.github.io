I quickly learned the difference between effective managing and ineffective managing. Through this experience, I was able to learn more about how people work, operate, and the ways they respond to different types of mangagement. I learned that each day presents new challenges and therefore creative and custom solutions. My job also consisted of interacting with guests throughout the dining room and completing closing procedures such as cash reconcilations, inventory, and simple administrative work.

          When I was fourteen years old I wanted to have a job, but quickly realized that my age was constricting factor in pursuit of that dream. As a solution, I created my own small-scale lawn care and landscaping business. Being in school my business was restricted by the hours in which I could work due to school. Despite this being a roadblock, I grew my business to generate over $14,000 annually. I had a client base that reached about 20 properties at its peak. Every weekend my team of 1-2 employees and I would service these properties. Additionally, we would perform large scale cleanups on varying properties. In 2021, I moved to Southwest Florida for school and began to manage my business reomtely. After about one year, I was able to sell the business and capital equipment.
