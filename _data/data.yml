          As an economics student, I have learned to be a critical thinker. Not only have I learned practical knowledge that is directly applicable in the business world, but in my schooling I have also gained a new perspective that helps me make better decisions. I have especially thrived in macroeconomics where I learned in depth about monetary policy, growth theory, and the international trade.

          As a real estate finance student, I have been able to learn valuable knowledge about various topics in real estate. In my classes, I have worked extensively with real estate income statements; I learned about NOI and how it impacts property productivity and valuation. Regarding valuation, I learned about the three general methods of valuation(sales comparison, cost, and income). In my valuation class I also learned about statistical modeling using regression analysis.  Continuing from NOI, I learned to work my way down to before tax cash flow and after tax cash flow as well. With this, I also learned about tax sheltering. All of these impact both first year returns and holding period returns that we learned about in my real estate investments class. Additionally, I learned about limits on debt like loan to value and debt service coverage ratios. We covered different types of loans like RAMs, CAMs, ARMs, and interest only loans. One of my favorite parts of my education was putting this all together to create a dynamic pro forma from scratch in excel of a sample property.

          When I was fourteen years old I wanted to get a job, but quickly realized that my age was a constricting factor in pursuit of that dream. As a solution, I created my own small-scale lawn care and landscaping business. Being in school, my business was restricted by the hours in which I could work. Despite this being a roadblock, I grew my business to generate over $14,000 annually. I had a client base that reached over 20 properties at its peak. Every weekend my team of 2 employees and I would service these properties. Additionally, we would perform large scale cleanups on varying properties. In 2021, I moved to Southwest Florida for school and began to manage my business reomtely. After one year, I was able to sell the business and equipment.
